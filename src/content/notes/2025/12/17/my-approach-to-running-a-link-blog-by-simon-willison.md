[My approach to running a link blog](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/) ([via](https://simonwillison.net/)). A note can start with a link and add commentary. My preference is not to insert a new line break after the link. Simon calls this a "blogmark" — a smarter way to bookmark. Instead of letting links pile up in a folder and fade from memory, I capture them here with context about why they matter to me.

This pattern turns my blog into a second brain: links I discover, ideas I find interesting, resources I want to revisit — all in one place, all searchable, all part of my timeline.

This note itself demonstrates the pattern.
