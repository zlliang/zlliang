A note can introduce a blog post.

Posts are for long-form writing — essays, tutorials, deep dives. They don't appear in the timeline directly, so each post gets a companion note like this one. The note links to the post, and I can add context or commentary here: why I wrote it, what I learned, or what I hope readers take away.

The post linked above demonstrates the Markdown syntax supported by this site. It's mostly a reference for myself.
