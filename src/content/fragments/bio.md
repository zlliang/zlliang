Welcome! I'm **Zilong**, currently working as a [Web Frontend Developer](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) at [Booking.com](https://booking.com/). Previously, I worked at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/) and [ByteDance](https://bytedance.com). I'm also a tenor member of the [Shanghai Rainbow Chamber Singers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Rainbow_Chamber_Singers). I hold a Master's degree in Mathematics from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/). This is my notebook where I write about **personal growth**, **life reflections**, and **technical learnings**. Hope you enjoy! 🎉
