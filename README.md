# 👨🏻‍💻 Zilong Liang

Hey there! I'm Zilong, a frontend developer at [Booking.com](https://booking.com/). Previously, I worked at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/) and [ByteDance](https://bytedance.com). I'm deeply passionate about programming, with a focus on web frontend development, though my interests span across the broader software landscape.

When I'm not coding, you can find me singing as a tenor with the [Shanghai Rainbow Chamber Singers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Rainbow_Chamber_Singers), a choir that brings together music enthusiasts from all walks of life. I hold a Master's degree in Mathematics from Fudan University.

I share my thoughts on **personal growth**, **life reflections**, and **technical learnings** on [my personal website](https://zlliang.me). Feel free to stop by and say hi! 👋
