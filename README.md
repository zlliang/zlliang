# 👨🏻‍💻 Zilong Liang

I'm Zilong, a frontend developer at [Booking.com](https://booking.com/). I'm passionate about programming — with a focus on web development, though my curiosity spans the broader software landscape. Before Booking, I worked at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/) and [ByteDance](https://bytedance.com).

Beyond code, I cherish life's simple pleasures: good food, cooking, reading, writing, and traveling. I also sing tenor with the [Shanghai Rainbow Chamber Singers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Rainbow_Chamber_Singers). I hold a Master's degree in Mathematics from Fudan University.

I share my thoughts on **technical learnings**, **personal growth**, and **life reflections** on [my personal website](https://zlliang.me). Stop by and say hi! 👋
