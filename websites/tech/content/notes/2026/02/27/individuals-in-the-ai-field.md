Individuals I'm following, who actively write and contribute in the AI field:

- [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/). A must-read in this field now. He's been topping [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) in 2023–2025[^1]. I can't believe how he manages to cover nearly every aspect of the frontier. If you could only follow one source, make it him. He's also the co-creator of the famous [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework.
- [Armin Ronacher](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/). He's the creator of a lot of Python libraries, like [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) and [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/). Now he's writing a lot about LLMs.
- [Mario Zechner](https://mariozechner.at/). I discovered him through his tiny but curated coding agent [Pi](https://pi.dev/), which has been turning heads recently[^2]. I haven't taken a look yet, but will do.
- [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://mitchellh.com/). [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)'s creator. He's writing a lot about his AI adoption in real development.
