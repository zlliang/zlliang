[The Value of Things](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2026/01/24/the-value-of-things/). Another article about the AI trend (see the [previous one](/notes/2026/02/11/i-started-programming-when-i-was-7-im-50-now-and-the-thing-i-loved-has-changed)). This time from Bob Nystrom, one of my favorite writers.
