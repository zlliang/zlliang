Here's what I missed in the AI field this week — I was on holiday in Tokyo.

Two new models dropped within about 15 minutes of each other: [Claude Opus 4.6](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6) and [GPT-5.3-Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex/). [Amp](https://ampcode.com/) immediately adopted Opus 4.6 for its `smart` mode, but GPT-5.3-Codex is only available in their [Codex](https://chatgpt.com/codex) app, not yet via the API. I believe Amp will adopt it for its `deep` mode once it's generally available.

Amp is sunsetting the editor extension next month. It hasn't been officially announced yet, but the team mentioned it in their latest [_Raising An Agent_ podcast episode](https://ampcode.com/podcast/episode-10). I use Amp exclusively through the editor extension, so unfortunately I'll have to switch to the TUI version and get used to it.

[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)'s author [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://mitchellh.com/) has been busy lately:

- Ghostty's [_updated AI usage policy for contributions_](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/10412/). More and more open source projects are drowning in AI-generated issues and PRs submitted without human review — the slop. He proposed a new policy for dealing with this trend. It's not against AI, but makes every AI-generated contribution accountable to a human.
- [Vouch](https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch), a community trust management system. A tool that puts the policy above into practice. To mitigate the slop burden, open source projects should build a network to identify trustworthy contributors.
- [_My AI Adoption Journey_](https://mitchellh.com/writing/my-ai-adoption-journey). Mitchell's reflections on his AI adoption journey. Most of it resonates with me — and probably with every thoughtful developer.
