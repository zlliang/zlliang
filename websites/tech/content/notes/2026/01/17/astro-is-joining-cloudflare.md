[Astro is joining Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/astro-joins-cloudflare/). I always had a feeling [Astro](https://astro.build/) would be acquired — and now it's happening. Astro has been my favorite framework for building static websites, and it's my choice for my personal websites now. It reminds me of when I first discovered static site generators like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) — **just basic build-time templating and composition**, making creating a blog very easy. Features like [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/guides/content-collections/) and [islands](https://docs.astro.build/concepts/islands/) are genuinely innovative. I hope it stays productive and keeps its simplicity.
