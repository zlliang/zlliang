I just added a new category of notes called "[collection notes](/notes/categories/collection)".

Collection notes gather resources on a single topic — books, articles, videos — in one place. Think of them as better-organized bookmark folders. Here's the commit: [zlliang/zlliang@d4c1f5a](https://github.com/zlliang/zlliang/commit/d4c1f5a00c2bd67610a37eb841220d22b04c494f).

I've already written one on my [Zilong's Days](https://days.zlliang.me) (Chinese) website: [_Shinobu Yoshii's works_](https://days.zlliang.me/notes/2026/01/22/shinobu-yoshiis-works).
