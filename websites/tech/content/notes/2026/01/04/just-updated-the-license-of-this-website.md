I just updated the license of this website. Now it's dual-licensed: code under [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), content under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Previously I used [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) for content, but decided to go more open — fewer restrictions, more sharing.

Here's the commit: [zlliang/zlliang@6083f34](https://github.com/zlliang/zlliang/commit/6083f3434746403193cbf0ec5f384977567fa941).
