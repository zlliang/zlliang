[Diffs](https://diffs.com/) ([via](https://x.com/thorstenball/status/2016906711928283358)). [Amp](https://ampcode.com) is planning to support code diffs for threads, built on this library. Its functionality, demo, and docs are all neat. Bookmarking it here so if I ever need to build code diff functionality, I'll have it handy.
