[Tw93](https://tw93.fun/), and his [Mole](https://github.com/tw93/Mole). I heard of this macOS cleaner app called Mole before, but today I finally tried it out — a neat CLI utility that digs through and cleans up your macOS.

I checked out its author, Tw93. He's also a Chinese programmer, and keeps a blog that caught my eye immediately. I'm glad to see programmers like him sharing tech thoughts and personal life, reminding me I'm not alone. He's doing a great job — another role model to look up to. From his [GitHub profile](https://github.com/tw93), I believe [Simon Willison](https://github.com/simonw) influenced him too.
