Happy New Year! Here's a quick recap of my New Year's break:

I finished watching [_The King of Internet Writing_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OZ94b3fJvo), a video podcast by [David Perell](https://perell.com/) about what we can learn from [Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com/)'s writing. I'm ready to write more, and better, in 2026.

On New Year's Eve, I was traveling with my partner in [Chongqing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing). We ate spicy hotpot and walked through the hilly streets!

I'm planning to add new features to this website. I created two GitHub issues, following Simon Willison's approach to building features[^1]:

- [#71: Support bilingual content with AI-assisted translation](https://github.com/zlliang/zlliang/issues/71)
- [#72: Support search across notes](https://github.com/zlliang/zlliang/issues/72)
