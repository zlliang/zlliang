Last weekend, I reorganized my personal websites. Here's the new structure:

| Website | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Personal landing page | [https://zlliang.me](https://zlliang.me) | Brief introduction and navigation |
| Zilong's Tech Notes | [https://tech.zlliang.me](https://tech.zlliang.me) | Tech learning and research (English) |
| Zilong's Days | [https://days.zlliang.me](https://days.zlliang.me) | Daily life and reflections (Chinese) |

In this post, I explain my motivation for splitting the sites. After this change, I'm ready to mark version 1.0 of my writing framework. The permalinks will be stable, and I'm excited to share more technical and personal topics in these spaces.
