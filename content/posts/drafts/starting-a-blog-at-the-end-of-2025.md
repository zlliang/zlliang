title: Starting a Blog at the End of 2025

## A thousand attempts

I used to keep a Chinese diary in Notion.

In the last ten years, I've tried a lot of tech stacks for my blog, starting with the ancient [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), then [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/). It's more of like a playground for my web frontend development learning, instead of a place for writing. This journey even helped me find my first job as a frontend developer in [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/). After all, I did't really start writing real content until now.

## Following the writers I admire

### Josh Comeau

Some of his excellent write-ups about web frontend:

- [_An Interactive Guide to Flexbox_](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/)
- [_Understanding useMemo and useCallback_](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/usememo-and-usecallback/)
- [_Understanding Layout Algorithms_](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/understanding-layout-algorithms/)
- [_The Quest for the Perfect Dark Mode_](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/dark-mode/)

### Alex Kladov (matklad)

Some of his pearls:
- [_Zig's Lovely Syntax_](https://matklad.github.io/2025/08/09/zigs-lovely-syntax.html)
- [_Caches in Rust_](https://matklad.github.io/2022/06/11/caches-in-rust.html)
- [_Study of `std::io::Error`_](https://matklad.github.io/2020/10/15/study-of-std-io-error.html)
- [_Simple but Powerful Pratt Parsing_](https://matklad.github.io/2020/04/13/simple-but-powerful-pratt-parsing.html)

### Bob Nystrom

I know Bob Nystrom from his masterpiece [_Crafting Interpreters_](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

His long-form writing is shining. The famous [_What color is your function_](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/) reveals another chapter for how people think asynchronous programming.

What's precious is that he can put the diffcult concepts in a extremely simple and clear way. Many posts are about programming language design and compilers, including _Crafting Interpreters_, the book. A hard topic. But I can read any of them as a newcomer to the field, and take away a bunch of insightful ideas and a fundamental understanding of the topic he covered.

Highly recommended ones:
- [_Does Go Have Subtyping?_]([text](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2023/10/19/does-go-have-subtyping/))
- [_Crafting "Crafting Interpreters"_](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2020/04/05/crafting-crafting-interpreters/)
- [_The Hardest Program I've Ever Written_](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/09/08/the-hardest-program-ive-ever-written/)
- [_What Color is Your Function?_](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)
- [_Pratt Parsers: Expression Parsing Made Easy_](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2011/03/19/pratt-parsers-expression-parsing-made-easy/)

His depth in relevant topics, fluent writing, and humor all along make his writing a fascinating journey for readers.

For both Bob and Alex, solid technical understanding and insight are their foundation of great writing.

### Simon Willison

Simon Willison has been maintaining his blog for over 20 years — an astonishing length of time. [The initial entry](https://simonwillison.net/2002/Jun/12/webStandards/) was written in Jun 2002, with only one sentence. Then the second one _[Blogging aint easy](https://simonwillison.net/2002/Jun/12/bloggingAintEasy/)_ follows, from which we can know he started with PHP as the language of his original blog system. What's precious is such old write-ups are still there, accessible to every new reader like me. As a contrast, many links in his blog entries are broken, failed to persist in this rapidly changing internet.

<!-- That's the value of plain text and self-hosted. -->

One of his innovations is **blogmarks**. A blogmark looks like as follows:

> [The new ChatGPT Images is here](https://openai.com/index/new-chatgpt-images-is-here/). OpenAI shipped an update to their ChatGPT Images feature ...

A link, and then followed by notes and comments. More often, the link is discovered via a third-party, like [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) or [X](https://x.com/). Simon adds a `(via)` to indicate the source, like:

> [ty: An extremely fast Python type checker and LSP](https://astral.sh/blog/ty) ([via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46294289)) The team at Astral have been working on this for quite a long time, and are finally releasing the first beta. They have some big performance claims ...

I found blogmarks a great idea.

Unlike normal technical writers, Simon Willison maintains his blog like his own social media, short posts like blogmarks and quotes dropped frequently like two or three times a day. As a result, his blog becomes a huge collection of content. I found this very inspiring because long-form writing has friction on a high level. Make writing casual and fluidly makes it more accessible and engaging.

Some of his excellent write-ups:

- [_My approach to running a link blog_](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/)
- [_The Perfect Commit_](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/29/the-perfect-commit/)
- [_How I build a feature_](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jan/12/how-i-build-a-feature/)

## What to write, and how

### Three phases imagined

**Phase 1:** Imitate the writers I admire—observing and learning how they write, the language they use, and how they discuss the topics they care about.

**Phase 2:** Gradually develop my own perspective and style

**Phase 3:** Form my thoughts on things I'm interested, and expand to topics like personal growth and life reflections

### Notes and posts

## My AI companion

In this new era of AI, writing in a foreign language becomes accessible like never before. I'm neither a programmer protesting agains AI nor a hyped AI tooling chaser. I value handcrafted writing and agree writing is thinking. I use AI just for reviewing my write-ups, fixing grammar and style issues and as a tool to help me develop my own writing style in English.

My current coding agent is [Amp](https://ampcode.com). Here is my typical prompt for it helping me review my write-ups:

> Review this write-up in terms of:
>
> 1. Grammar and and writing style
> 2. Awkward or unnatural expressions
> 3. The topic and overall content

And here's my instruction file for my personal website repository: [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/zlliang/zlliang/blob/03cc46c43eeea0da3afc4e11dff2f14d7d749799/AGENTS.md).


## Looking forward to this journey

The following plans are spinning in my mind:
- Pagination and search functionality for notes
- Pinned posts as living documentations
- Chinese contents, living in a separate subsite
