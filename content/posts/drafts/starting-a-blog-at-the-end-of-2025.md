## A thousand attempts

I used to keep a Chinese diary in Notion.

In the last ten years, I've tried a lot of tech stacks for my blog, starting with the ancient [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), then [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/). It's more of like a playground for my web frontend development learning, instead of a place for writing. This journey even helped me found my first job as a frontend developer in [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/). After all, I did't really start writing real content until now.

## Following the writers I admire

### Alex Kladov (matklad)

### Bob Nystrom

### Simon Willison

Simon Willison has been maintaining his blog for over 20 years — an astonishing length of time. [The initial entry](https://simonwillison.net/2002/Jun/12/webStandards/) was written in Jun 2002, with only one sentence. Then the second one _[Blogging aint easy](https://simonwillison.net/2002/Jun/12/bloggingAintEasy/)_ follows, from which we can know he started with PHP as the language of his original blog system. What's precious is such old write-ups are still there, accessible to every new reader like me. As a contrast, many links in his blog entries are broken, failed to persist in this rapidly changing internet.

<!-- That's the value of plain text and self-hosted. -->

One of his innovations is **blogmarks**. A blogmark looks like as follows:

> [The new ChatGPT Images is here](https://openai.com/index/new-chatgpt-images-is-here/). OpenAI shipped an update to their ChatGPT Images feature ...

A link, and then followed by notes and comments. More often, the link is discovered via a third-party, like [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) or [X](https://x.com/). Simon adds a `(via)` to indicate the source, like:

> [ty: An extremely fast Python type checker and LSP](https://astral.sh/blog/ty) ([via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46294289)) The team at Astral have been working on this for quite a long time, and are finally releasing the first beta. They have some big performance claims ...

I found blogmarks a great idea.

## What to write, and how

### Three phases imagined

**Phase 1:** Imitate the writers I admire—observing and learning how they write, the language they use, and how they discuss the topics they care about.

**Phase 2:** Gradually develop my own perspective and style

### Notes and posts

## My AI companion

## Looking forward to this journey

The following plans are spinning in my mind:
- Pagination and search functionality for notes
- Pinned posts as living documentations
- Chinese contents, living in a separate subsite
