I now use [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and [Amp](https://ampcode.com/) in a very simple way: I just create new threads and leave them as-is.

Previously for ChatGPT, I created several projects, and when I wanted to talk to it, I'd find and continue a relevant existing thread or create a new one in a project. I'd organize them periodically. Turns out it just looked neat but didn't actually help. Now I just start a new chat when I think I need to. ChatGPT memorizes context automatically, which is sufficient.

Similarly for Amp, I used to organize my threads very carefully. After the labels feature shipped[^1], I started to label every thread manually after I completed one. I finally realized this practice doesn't help — for now. So I deleted all the labels. And when to make a thread public? When I find I need to.

When you start using a tool, use it with the least friction and in the most intuitive way. Any feature that forces redundant manual work isn't worth the hassle. Only use a feature if you find you **need to**.
