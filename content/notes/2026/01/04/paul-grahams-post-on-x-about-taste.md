[Paul Graham's post on X about taste](https://x.com/paulg/status/2007487786505646369). Another interesting post from [Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com/)[^1] — what struck me is how his posts spark real discussion. All the comments are worth reading. I'm following him now.

Oddly enough, I first learned about Paul Graham through his essays, and only later realized he co-founded Y Combinator and is such a central figure in Silicon Valley.
