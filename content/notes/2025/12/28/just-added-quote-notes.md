I just added a new category of notes called "[quote notes](/notes/categories/quote)". Quote notes share quotes from books, articles, and other sources, sometimes with my own commentary.

Here's the commit: [zlliang/zlliang@3419c89](https://github.com/zlliang/zlliang/commit/3419c89f33c19dbb95dd3b492560e07357b66a9a). I also updated the relevant descriptions in [_Starting a Blog at the End of 2025_](/posts/2025/12/25/starting-a-blog-at-the-end-of-2025).
