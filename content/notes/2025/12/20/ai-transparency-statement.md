[AI Transparency Statement](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/ai-transparency/) ([via](https://x.com/simonw/status/2002101707954897303)). More and more content on the internet is generated by AI these days, and there's a new word [_slop_](https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/8/slop/) to describe the wave of unwanted, unreviewed, and low-value AI-generated content. It's so alarming that people are starting to be paranoid about the quality of the content they see online, even obviously handcrafted and curated ones.

One of the indicators is the em dashes (—). Since AI-generated content often includes em dashes, they become a signal, and a warning: you might be reading AI-generated content.

It's usually not true. But the paranoia runs so deep that some writers like [Armin Ronacher](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/) now publish statements to defend their work.

As for me, I guarantee that all content here is written by me, though I do use AI tools to help review and refine my writing (like [this one](https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019b38d6-60d2-73d9-9582-401baeaa3375)), and it's me who does the thinking and makes the final decision. That's an appropriate way to use AI as an editing tool, in my opinion. Maybe I should write a similar statement for this website too — and maybe every content creator should do the same.
