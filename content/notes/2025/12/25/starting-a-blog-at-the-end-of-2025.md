Happy holidays! At the end of 2025, I'm starting a blog. I've already written several entries and feel confident I can keep it going.

Here I talk about my past attempts, the writers who inspired me, the motivation, the topics to cover, and the approach I'm taking. It's my version of a blogging manifesto.
