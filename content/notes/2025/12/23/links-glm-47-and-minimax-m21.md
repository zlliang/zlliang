[GLM 4.7](https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.7) and [MiniMax M2.1](https://www.minimax.io/news/minimax-m21). Chinese AI labs first caught the world's attention with the [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/) models in late 2024. Then in the second half of 2025, we saw a wave of Chinese open-source models like [GLM 4.6](https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.6), [MiniMax M2](https://www.minimax.io/news/minimax-m2), and [Kimi K2](https://moonshotai.github.io/Kimi-K2/)[^1]. People like these models for their low price, open weights, and solid performance — just slightly below state-of-the-art proprietary models.

Today, the updated GLM 4.7 and MiniMax M2.1 dropped on the same day. As public holidays approach in the US, Chinese AI labs keep pushing forward, making good use of the time 😉

AI is a rapidly changing field. I'm not one to chase every new model release, though I do find myself following this topic more recently. I'm still learning these concepts and trying to find a pragmatic way to use AI tools. I use [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) as my daily driver, [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) for work (my company subscribes to it), and [Amp](https://ampcode.com) as my coding agent.

I may not post about every model release in the future, but here are the models on my radar:

- Proprietary models: [GPT (OpenAI)](https://openai.com), [Claude (Anthropic)](https://www.anthropic.com/), and [Gemini (Google)](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/)
- Open-source models: [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/), [Kimi (Moonshot AI)](https://www.moonshot.ai/), [GLM (Z.ai)](https://z.ai), and [MiniMax](https://www.minimax.io/)
