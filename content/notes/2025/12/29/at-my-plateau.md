I'm just reminded of the growth curve [Andrew Kelley](https://andrewkelley.me/) showed in his talk [_A Practical Guide to Applying Data Oriented Design_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IroPQ150F6c). I watched it several days ago and realized I'm now at a plateau of my own. Back in university, I built a solid foundation in web frontend and landed a job in it. Now I've hit another bottleneck, eager to jump to the next stage. Andrew found his trigger in a book; I'm still looking for mine. But two strategies are already in my mind: **writing** and **starting my own projects**. I bet that producing and creating will push me to evolve.
